    <h2>My Life in Varanasi </h2>
    <div class="my">
        <p>
            Everyone loves his hometown or city dearly. It is like loving the home or the place where one passes oneâ€™s
            life. My town is close to a canal that flows out of the river some eight kilometers away. Gardens and parks
            surround it on all sides. Beautiful flowers and tasty fruits of all the seasons are to be found welcoming
            you as you approach the town. Grassy grounds border the town where children, men, and women are found
            playing in the afternoon.
            <br><br>
            The town has two colleges, one for boys and another for girls. It also has four high schools and six middle
            schools. The students are mostly from middle-class or rich families, but now some working-class people like
            laborers have started sending their children to schools. We have quite high standards of education as we
            have in some famous colleges and schools in the big cities. The reason is the hard work that teachers put in
            and the interest that most of the students take in studies.
            <br><br>
            The town has a fine public hospital where most government doctors attend to patients as well as they can the
            public dislikes the few careless doctors. They are often transferred on the public complaint. Of course, the
            hospital is often overcrowded and suitable medicines are in short supply. The richer people go to private
            clinics where they get medical treatment of their choice.
            <br><br>
            The town municipal committee keeps the town clean, but sometimes garbage heaps collect, and the whole place
            begins stinking (giving an unpleasant smell). The electricity department takes care that the streets are
            brightly lit at night. When people have complaints about its working, it begins performing better. The
            police and other government departments in the town, on the whole, have been performing their duties equally
            well. The people of the town have now started complaining of rising corruption in government offices. It is
            time we checked it with most strictly. When I am away from my town, I feel as if I am away from something
            dearest in life.
