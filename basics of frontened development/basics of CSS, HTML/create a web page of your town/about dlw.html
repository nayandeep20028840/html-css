    <h2>History</h2>
    <i>Founded in 1961 as the DLW, it rolled out its first locomotive three years later, on 3 January 1964.
        It manufactures locomotives which are variants based on the original ALCO designs dating to 1960s
        and the GM EMD designs of the 1990s. In July 2006, DLW outsourced manufacture of some locomotives to Parel
        Workshop,
        Central Railway, Mumbai.[3] In 2016, it bagged "Best Production Unit Shield 2015-16"
        The first phase of expansion project of BLW was initiated in 2016. In 2017, it bagged the "Best Production Unit
        Shield
        2016-17" for 2nd consecutive year. In 2018, it bagged the "Best Production Unit Shield 2017-18" of
        Indian Railways for 3rd consecutive year. In March 2018 it successfully converted two old ALCO diesel
        loco WDG3A into an electric loco WAGC-3 (WAG-10), a first in the world. DLW stopped manufacturing diesel
        locomotives
        in March 2019 and was renamed to BLW in Oct 2020.[2] It was the largest diesel-electric locomotive manufacturer
        in India.
        In March 2019, it developed the country's first bi-mode locomotive, the WDAP-5. BLW today produces mostly
        electric locomotives WAP-7 & WAG-9.[4]</i>
