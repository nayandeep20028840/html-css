    <h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> Archer Industries</h2>
    <p style="background-color:Tomato;">The environment in which Archer Industries companies operate is increasingly
      challenging, being driven by a more and more demanding healthcare agenda. The global need for innovative, cost
      effective medicines continues to rise whilst regulators, payers, health care providers and patients are demanding
      greater value for money, proven effectiveness of products, more transparency and access to information. To meet
      these demands companies are seeking ways to improve R&D productivity, increase the efficiency of its operations,
      rationalise spending on sales and marketing and enhance financial performance.

      Working closely with our clients, ranging from small entrepreneurial life science companies to large global
      corporations, we aim to achieve increased performance by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a company’s
      key business operations.

      Across the whole Archer Industries value chain, PwC's trusted consultants and professional advisors use their
      wealth of industry based experience, knowledge and expertise to help our clients evaluate their strategic business
      options, improve management and control, and identify cost saving initiatives.</p>
