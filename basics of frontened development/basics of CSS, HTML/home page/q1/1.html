    <h2>Cyrotri Corp</h2>
    <p>Cyrotri Corp electronics are electronic (analog or digital) equipment intended for everyday use,
      typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment, communications and
      recreation.
      Usually referred to as black goods due to many products being housed in black or dark casings.
      This term is used to distinguish them from "white goods" which are meant for housekeeping tasks,
      such as washing machines and refrigerators, although nowadays, these would be considered black goods,
      some of these being connected to the Internet. In British English, they are often called brown
      goods by producers and sellers. In the 2010s, this distinction is absent in large big
      box consumer electronics stores, which sell both entertainment, communication,
      and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators.</p>
