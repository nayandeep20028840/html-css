    <h4 style="color:white">If you’ve been a fan of first person shooters for any amount of time, you’re probably
        already familiar with the Halo series. And, though it has two decades of history behind it, the newest entry,
        Halo Infinite, is not a lazy attempt to cash in on a beloved name. Instead, it delivers the kind of sublime FPS
        experience you would want out of a Halo game, complete with the return of Master Chief.
        Not only is it a beautiful looking game that delivers a ton of fun, but if the multiplayer experience is why you
        game, you’ll be pleased to find out that that part of the game is free.

        <h2 style="color:white"><u>Ghostrunner</u></h2>
    </center>
    <h4 style="color:white">Ultra-violence and constant motion meet in this post-apocalyptic dystopian game. This FPP is
        not for the faint of heart – it’s tense, exhilarating, and you will probably die over and over trying to beat
        it. If you ever wanted a game that came in equal parts Doom Eternal and Mirror’s Edge, you found it in
        Ghostrunner.
        The game is set in Dharma Tower, a sort-of last refuge for humanity, where you ascend the tower through
        platforming and katana-induced carnage to take revenge on a ruthless ruler. You do so by slicing up your
        enemies, dodging bullets, and using a number of unique abilities to continue making your way to the top. This is
        the kind of game that will leave you out of breath just playing it. And, if that sounds like your kind of game,
        then you’re in for a treat.

        <h2 style="color:white"><u>God of War</u></h2>
    </center>
    <h4 style="color:white">God of War as a series has been around since 2005. And, though it’s had many entries over
        the years, the one from 2018 has reinvigorated the series, whether that’s due to a new setting – you’re not
        exploring some hellscape version of Greece anymore – or the fact that Kratos now has a companion on his journey.
        This former Playstation exclusive finds you playing as Kratos, the demigod that’s taken down just about the
        entire Greek pantheon in the previous games, as he and his son travel to the top of the mountain to scatter his
        dead wife’s ashes in a Norse-inspired mythological setting. Of course, being a God of War game, you’ll have to
        fight your way through all sorts of creatures and gods on the way.
