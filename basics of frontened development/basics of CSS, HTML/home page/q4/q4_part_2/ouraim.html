        <h2 align="center">
            Practice makes perfect, and focused practice makes most perfect of all. There are a 
            few things you can do that will help you to improve faster than just playing a bunch of 
            games and hoping to git gud. Broadly speaking, there are two types of aiming in FPS titles: 
            Tracking and Flickshots. Tracking is where you keep your crosshairs focused on your 
            target whilst you fire, adapting as you move and they move to keep them in your sights. 
            It’s best used with DPS characters firing machineguns or similar weapons. Flickshots 
            involve flicking your crosshairs over to shoot at a precise point – like someone’s 
            head – before returning to a neutral position. Reflexes are a big part of successful 
            flickshots, and they’re used with powerful but low rate of fire weapons like sniper rifles.
