      <p>
        H C Verma s Concepts Of Physics is an all-inclusive book,
        which serves to detail out the ABC of physics in an intricate manner making
        it an ideal book for not only the higher secondary students,
        but also for those who are preparing for their competitive examinations.
        Physics as a subject is vast and to have all the concepts of Physics compiled in one book is indeed a boon to
        all students.
        The book has been tailored to meet the needs 10 + 2 or higher secondary students and for the students
        who are appearing for a competitive examination. It has everything a student would possibly need for their
        success in exams.
        The book comes supplemented with a large number of solved and unsolved problems.
        Numerical exercises inundate the book for a better understanding of the subject.
        The book starts with an Introduction to Physics and goes on to elucidate the concept of Physics and Mathematics
        in the second chapter. In the third chapter the author talks about Rest and Motion: Kinematics.
        In the fourth chapter he moves on to discuss the concept of Forces.
        Newton s Laws of Motion is elaborated in the fifth chapter and the theory of Friction is expanded in the sixth
        chapter.
