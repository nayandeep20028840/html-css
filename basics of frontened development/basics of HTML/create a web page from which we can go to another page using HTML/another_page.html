        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a
        private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to
        complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks
        to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
        client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
        development.

        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites:
        writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes
        easier and available with basic technical skills.
