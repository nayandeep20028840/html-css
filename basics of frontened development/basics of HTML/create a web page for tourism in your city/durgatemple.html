    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Durga Temple</h1>

    <p>
        The 18th century Durga temple lies south of the main city, away from the ghats of Varanasi. A narrow lane
        flanked by flower and puja paraphernalia vendors leads up to this ancient temple. Inside, the low roofed, bright
        red walled temple has a small sanctum with a vivid idol of the Devi riding a tiger, armed with a trident,
        discus, and sword. Navratras are celebrated with great vigour in this temple. When in Varanasi, make sure to pay
        a visit at this famous Durga Temple.
