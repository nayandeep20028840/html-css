    <p>
        Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple is a Hindu temple in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India and is dedicated to the Hindu
        God Hanuman. The temple was established by famous Hindu preacher and poet saint Sri Goswami Tulsidas in the
        early 16th century and is situated on the banks of the Assi river. The deity was named "Sankat Mochan" meaning
        the "reliever from troubles".[1]

        In the temple, offerings to Lord Hanuman (called Prasad) are sold like the special sweet "besan ke ladoo", which
        the devotees relish; the idol is also decked with a pleasant marigold flower garland as well. This temple has
        the unique distinction of having Lord Hanuman facing his Lord, Rama, whom he worshipped with steadfast and
        selfless devotion
