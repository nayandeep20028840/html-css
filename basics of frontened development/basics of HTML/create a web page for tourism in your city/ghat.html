    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Varanasi ghats</h1>
    <p>
        The stepped banks (ghats) lie in a crescent shape along the Ganga River in Varanasi. These spring into action as
        early as 4 am and are buzzing with activity until late night. Hiring a boat to ride along the river is a good
        way to see all the action - morning ablutions, people praying the two burning ghats (photography not allowed
        even from the boat) and the bright umbrella dotted platforms where priests hold small ceremonies for pilgrims.
        Old havelis and palaces lie on the fringes of the river, ensuring a stunning landscape of unique architecture
        along the entire stretch. These are often used as backdrops for Bollywood movies or homes, since most of the
        royalty has abandoned these. The most spectacular spectacle at the ghats is the Ganga aarti that is held every
        evening between 6.15 and 7.15 pm on five ghats. Of these, the Dashashwamedh Ghat aarti is the oldest and the
        most famous one. Five to seven priests perform the daily ceremony with large fire lit lamps, bells and conchs,
        as hundreds converge towards the ghat in the evening

        The word ghat is explained by numerous Dravidian etymons such as Kannada gatta (mountain range) Tamil kattu
        (side of a mountain, dam, ridge, causeway) and Telugu katta and gattu (dam, embankment).[2]

        Ghat, a term used in the Indian subcontinent, depending on the context could either refer to a range of
        stepped-hill such as Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats; or the series of steps leading down to a body of water or
        wharf, such bathing or cremation place along the banks of a river or pond, Ghats in Varanasi, Dhoby Ghaut or
        Aapravasi Ghat.[3][4] Roads passing through ghats are called Ghat Roads.
        Assi Ghat
        This ghat that used to lie at the confluence of the Ganges with the dry river Asi marks the traditional southern
        boundary of the city. Asisangameshwar Temple at the ghat finds mention in the Kashi Khand of Skandmahapuran.
        This ghat is very popular because it is one of the very few ghats that is linked with the city through a wide
        street. It is also the major ghat that is closest to Banaras Hindu University. Assi ghat name is derived from
        the river Assi. PM MODI launched water ATM on 17th Sep 2015 on the occasion of PM birthday

        Dashashwamedh Ghat is located close to Vishwanath Temple, and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu
        mythologies are associated with it: According to one, Lord Brahma created it to welcome Lord Shiva. According to
        another, Lord Brahma sacrificed ten horses, during Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna performed here. A group of priests
        daily perform in the evening at this ghat "Agni Pooja" (Worship to Fire) wherein a dedication is made to Lord
        Shiva, River Ganges, Surya (Sun), Agni (Fire), and the whole universe.


        Two legends are associated with Manikarnika Ghat.[7] According to one, it is believed to be the place where Lord
        Vishnu dug a pit with his Chakra and filled it with his perspiration while performing various penances. While
        Lord Shiva was watching Lord Vishnu at that time, the latter's earring ("Manikarnika") fell into the pit.
        According to the second legend, to keep Lord Shiva from moving around with his devotees, his consort Goddess
        Parvati hid her earrings and asked him to find them, saying that they had been lost on the banks of the Ganges.
        Goddess Parvati's idea behind the fib was that Lord Shiva would then stay around, searching forever for the lost
        earrings. In this legend, whenever a body gets cremated at the Manikarnika Ghat, Lord Shiva asks the soul
        whether it has seen the earrings.

        According to ancient texts, the owner of Manikarnika Ghat bought King Harishchandra as a slave and made him work
        on the Manikarnika at Harishchandra Ghat. Hindu cremations customarily take place here, though a majority of
        dead bodies are taken for cremation to the Manikarnika Ghat.

        Situated near to Kashi railway station, this is one of the famous ghats of Varanasi. This is next to the Raj
        Ghat bridge. Famous Ravidas temple is located on this ghat. It is also famous for Pind Daan and asthi-visarjan.
        Famous priests of Kashi are based here. The ghats can easily be accessed through any kind of vehicles and
        parking facilities are also available here. This ghat is also friendly for disabled people who can not walk
        through narrow lanes of Kashi. They can easily reach here by car or bike.
