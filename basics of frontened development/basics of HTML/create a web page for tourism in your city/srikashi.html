    <p>
        The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali
        of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one
        of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath
        and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was called
        Kashi ("shining") in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
