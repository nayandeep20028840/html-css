        The Buddhist pilgrimage, Sarnath lies 10 km from Varanasi, and is yet another attraction that appeals to people
        from all around the world. This is the place where Gautum Buddha first gave his sermons on Dharma. The main deer
        park complex and a number of other Buddhist temples can be seen here. The Mulgandha Kuti Vihar temple, the
        Archaeological Museum, the Dhamek Stupa, the Chaukhandi Stupa and ruins of monasteries are the key highlights
