                    INTRODUCTION <CENTER><BR>
                        Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world.
                        Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author
                        and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : “Benaras
                        is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as
                        all of them put together. ”

                        The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus
                        believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom
                        from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi
                        are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of
                        mortals.

                        Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands to
                        the mighty river that we know of. The city is a center of learning and civilization for over
                        3000 years. With Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment,
                        just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge, philosophy,
                        culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for centuries. Also a
                        pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath, the
                        twenty-third Tirthankar.
