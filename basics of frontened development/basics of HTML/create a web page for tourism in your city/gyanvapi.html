    <p>
        The Gyanvapi Mosque is located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was constructed on the site of an older
        temple of Vishweshwar ("Lord of the world", an epithet of Shiva), which had been demolished by the Mughal
        Emperor Aurangzeb in 1669.[1]

        The Gyanvapi Mosque is a Jama Masjid located in the heart of the Varanasi city, north of Dashashwamedh Ghat,
        near Lalita Ghat along the river Ganga.[2] It is administered by Anjuman Inthazamiya Masjid (AIM).[3]
