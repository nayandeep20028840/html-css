    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Ramnagar Fort and Museum</h1>

    <p>
        A repository of the history of the kings of Varanasi, the Ramnagar fort and museum is located opposite
        Varanasiâ€™s Tulsi Ghat. This crumbling 17th century fort and palace on the eastern banks of the Ganga is a
        beautiful place to watch the sunset over the river. Built with red sandstone by the Maharaja of Banaras, the
        fort houses a temple and a museum within its compound.
