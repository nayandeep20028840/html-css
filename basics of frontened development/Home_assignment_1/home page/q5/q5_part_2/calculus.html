        Thomas' Calculus helps students reach the level of mathematical
        proficiency and maturity you require, but with support for students
        who need it through its balance of clear and intuitive explanations,
        current applications, and generalized concepts. In the 14th Edition,
        new co-author Christopher Heil (Georgia Institute of Technology)
        partners with author Joel Hass to preserve what is best about Thomas'
        time-tested text while reconsidering every word and every piece of art
        with today's students in mind. The result is a text that goes beyond
        memorizing formulas and routine procedures to help students generalize
        key concepts and develop deeper understanding.
