        <i><B>Speciality Medications</B>
            Sun Pharma has built a portfolio of patent protected speciality medicines for global markets. Over the
            years, we have nurtured this evolving business through increased focus and investments. The key segments we
            are targeting are dermatology, ophthalmology and oncology. Our focus is on improving patient outcomes either
            by addressing unmet medical needs or by enhancing patient convenience through differentiated dosage forms.
            Our initiatives in this segment cover the entire value chain, from in-licensing early-to-late stage clinical
            candidates, as well as getting access to on-market patented products. Today, we are among the leading
            branded companies in the US with several speciality products launched in the country.</i>

        <i><B>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients</B>
            We began producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in 1995 as a vital input in the manufacture of
            complex formulations to facilitate vertical integration. Today, our list of APIs exceeds 300 which is used
            in house as well as marketed to customers in over 60 countries. We manufacture APIs in 14 manufacturing
            facilities located in India, Hungary, US, Israel and Australia. Our product list includes generics and
            complex APIs that require isolated manufacturing areas like anti-cancers, peptides, steroids, sex hormones
            and controlled substances, including poppy-derived opiate raw materials that are primarily used in the
            manufacture of analgesics, sold as both Narcotic Raw Materials (NRM) and APIs. We offer bulk actives,
            intermediates and services for custom synthesis.</i>
