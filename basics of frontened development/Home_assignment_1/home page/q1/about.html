        <i>For its first fifty years the phonograph turntable did not use electronics; the needle and soundhorn were
            purely mechanical technologies. However, in the 1920s, radio broadcasting became the basis of mass
            production of radio receivers. The vacuum tubes that had made radios practical were used with record players
            as well, to amplify the sound so that it could be played through a loudspeaker. Television was soon
            invented, but remained insignificant in the consumer market until the 1950s.</i>

        <EM>The first working transistor, a point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser
            Brattain at Bell Laboratories in 1947, which led to significant research in the field of solid-state
            semiconductors in the early 1950s.[10] The invention and development of the earliest transistors at Bell led
            to transistor radios. This led to the emergence of the home entertainment consumer electronics industry
            starting in the 1950s, largely due to the efforts of Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now Sony) in successfully
            commercializing transistor technology for a mass market, with affordable transistor radios and then
            transistorized television sets.[11]</EM>
