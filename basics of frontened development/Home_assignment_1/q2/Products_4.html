        A virtual reality game or VR game is a video game played on virtual<br> reality (VR) hardware. Most VR games are based on player immersion, typically<br> through head-mounted display unit or headset and one or more controllers<br>. The headset typically provides two stereoscopic displays in front of the<br> user's eyes to simulate a 3D space<br>.The video game industry made early attempts at VR in the 1980s, most notably<br> with Mattel's Power Glove and Nintendo's Virtual Boy. With the<br> introduction of the first consumer-ready VR product, the Oculus Rift,<br> in 2013, VR games soon followed, including existing games<br> adapted for the VR hardware, and new games designed directly<br> for VR. While VR hardware and games grew modestly for the remainder<br> of the 2010s, Half-Life: Alyx, a full<br> VR game developed by Valve, was considered the killer application for VR games.
